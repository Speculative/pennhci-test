### Rule: Load project context at chat start

- On every new chat in this repository, read `project.md` and load into working memory:
  - The "Project context" section
  - The "Open tasks" checklist
- Treat `project.md` as the single source of truth for scope, pages, navigation, and work tracking.
- When tasks are added or completed, update `project.md` immediately and reference it in status updates.
- If `project.md` changes during a session, refresh the loaded context.

File to read: `project.md` (repo root)
